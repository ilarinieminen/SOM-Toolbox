%%%%%%%%%%%%% DETAILED DESCRIPTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% som_bmus
%
% PURPOSE
%
% Finds Best-Matching Units (BMUs) for given data vector from a given map.
%
% SYNTAX
%
%  Bmus = som_bmus(sMap, sData)
%  Bmus = som_bmus(..., which)
%  Bmus = som_bmus(..., which, mask)
%  [Bmus, Qerrs] = som_bmus(...)
%
% DESCRIPTION
%
% Returns the indexes and corresponding quantization errors of the
% vectors in sMap that best matched the vectors in sData.
%
% By default only the index of the best matching unit (/vector) is
% returned, but the 'which' argument can be used to get others as
% well. For example it might be desirable to get also second- and
% third-best matching units as well (which = [1:3]). 
%
% A mask can be used to weight the search process. The mask is used to
% weight the influence of components in the distance calculation, as
% follows: 
%
%   distance(x,y) = (x-y)' diag(mask) (x-y)
%
% where x and y are two vectors, and diag(mask) is a diagonal matrix with 
% the elements of mask vector on the diagonal. 
%
% The vectors in the data set (sData) can contain unknown components
% (NaNs), but the map (sMap) cannot. If there are completely empty
% vectors (all NaNs), the returned BMUs and quantization errors for those 
% vectors are NaNs.
%
% REQUIRED INPUT ARGUMENTS
%
%   sMap              The vectors from among which the BMUs are searched
%                     for. These must not have any unknown components (NaNs).
%            (struct) map struct
%            (matrix) codebook matrix, size munits x dim
%                     
%   sData             The data vector(s) for which the BMUs are searched.
%            (struct) data struct
%            (matrix) data matrix, size dlen x dim
%
% OPTIONAL INPUT ARGUMENTS 
%
%   which    (vector) which BMUs are returned, 
%                     by default only the best (ie. which = [1])
%            (string) 'all', 'best' or 'worst' meaning [1:munits],
%                     [1] and [munits] respectively  
%   mask     (vector) mask vector to be used in BMU search, 
%                     by default sMap.mask, or ones(dim,1) in case
%                     a matrix was given
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS
% 
%   Bmus     (matrix) the requested BMUs for each data vector, 
%                     size dlen x length(which)
%   Qerrors  (matrix) the corresponding quantization errors, 
%                     size equal to that of Bmus
%
% EXAMPLES
%
% Simplest case:
%  bmu = som_bmus(sM, [0.3 -0.4 1.0]);
%           % 3-dimensional data, returns BMU for vector [0.3 -0.4 1]
%  bmu = som_bmus(sM, [0.3 -0.4 1.0], [3 5]);
%           % as above, except returns the 3rd and 5th BMUs
%  bmu = som_bmus(sM, [0.3 -0.4 1.0], [], [1 0 1]);
%           % as above, except ignores second component in searching
%  [bmus qerrs] = som_bmus(sM, D);
%           % returns BMUs and corresponding quantization errors 
%           % for each vector in D
%  bmus = som_bmus(sM, sD);
%           % returns BMUs for each vector in sD using the mask in sM

%% action

Bmus = zeros(dlen,length(which_bmus));
Qerrors = Bmus;

% The BMU search involves calculating weighted Euclidian distances 
% to all map units for each data vector. Basically this is done as
%   for i=1:dlen, 
%     for j=1:munits, 
%       for k=1:dim,
%         Dist(j,i) = Dist(j,i) + mask(k) * (D(i,k) - M(j,k))^2;
%       end
%     end
%   end
% where mask is the weighting vector for distance calculation. However, taking 
% into account that distance between vectors m and v can be expressed as
%   |m - v|^2 = sum_i ((m_i - v_i)^2) = sum_i (m_i^2 + v_i^2 - 2*m_i*v_i)
% this can be made much faster by transforming it to a matrix operation:
%   Dist = (M.^2)*mask*ones(1,d) + ones(m,1)*mask'*(D'.^2) - 2*M*diag(mask)*D'
%
% In the case where there are unknown components in the data, each data
% vector will have an individual mask vector so that for that unit, the 
% unknown components are not taken into account in distance calculation.
% In addition all NaN's are changed to zeros so that they don't screw up 
% the matrix multiplications.

% calculate distances & bmus

% This is done a block of data at a time rather than in a
% single sweep to save memory consumption. The 'Dist' matrix has 
% size munits*blen which would be HUGE if you did it in a single-sweep
% operation. If you _want_ to use the single-sweep version, just 
% set blen = dlen. If you're having problems with memory, try to 
% set the value of blen lower. 
blen = min(munits,dlen);

  % find the bmus and the corresponding quantization errors
  if all(which_bmus==1), [Q B] = min(Dist); else [Q B] = sort(Dist); end
